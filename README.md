## Title: Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Hydrocarbons Kinetics Predictions
### Team: Vincent Dufour-DÃ©cieux, Anthony Taing. Stanford University
## Frameworks: Tensorflow 2.2, Keras
## Requirements
You can install Python dependencies of our environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and it should just work.
## Running the best model with best hyperparameters
`python run_all.py`

### In other_models directory, you will find few models with different hyperparameters and architecture used during our tuning step.To run our first basic model, we can do it with 'python train_mode.py', or 
'python train_modeltune.py' if we want to vary some elements.
